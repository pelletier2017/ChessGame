Things to remember
- make unit tests before refactoring anything
- change doc strings whenever code changes
- Pep8 and currently use " " rather than ' '

# TODO
- Work on extending minimax to do variable depth.

small features
- write a draw condition if both players cannot checkmate each other in X turns.
  Official chess rules should cover how to call a draw.
- have a game return some kind of result for who won, # of turns, # of pieces at the 
  end, snapshop of last board. Maybe a result object should be created and returned.
- MatchResult and GameResult classes within respective files?
- timer that ticks during game, maybe have it multi threaded (daemon?).
  Display may have to use curses library to not have to reprint everything.

large features
- simple interactive GUI with pygame or some other python library
  also could do it with flask, html/css/bootstrap/js hosted on heroku
  and make it play vs the AI!!
- As part of score evaluation, calculate # of pieces a player is attacking.
  This costs a lot of computation, but can be used for a good tie breaker for
  equal score values. Maybe have this as a boolean optional argument as part of
  player class. This way we can test if its better.
- player class DNA/gene pool class that includes many players,
  it can have method called play_games(100) or next_generation()
- for computation heavy parts of the project use python -O main.py (-O or -OO)
  to prevent assertion and hopefully speed things up.

features that come with object restructure:
- en passant may have to make chess board keep piece objects.
  Rules of en passant: only valid the move after your opponent moved into
  position. Pawn doesn't need state that says if it has moved because it will
  be in the correct row if it hasn't moved.
- castle, have to keep track of if king ever moved, or if rook ever moved

cleaning up code:
- clean up Board.is_attacking_king(flipped=True) ugly logic
- clean up Board.is_being_attacked, had to do ugly thing with modifying state
  and the whole thing is redundant, should return after first is_attacked.
  Ideally make it not have to modify state. In all its duct taped together.
- flip player turn method? Its used quite a bit.
- break apart is_square_attacked, its 120 lines long and easy to break apart
- make chess piece class into a stub class that cant be called
- rethink variable/method names, verify they're all easily understandable
- check to see if some unit tests can be shortened or made easier to modify
  with the use of helper functions.
- remove things from board.py if possible, its very long

edge cases to test:
- kings helping with check-mate
- castle body block (pieces in the way or pieces attacking inbetween)
- king cant take a piece if it puts him in check
- moving another piece which ends up putting your king in check

Things to consider:
- should both ChessGame and ChessBoard have default board?
  board should be able to go to any state on the board,
  game should be playing a game where the person who goes first could be chosen
  therefore, chess board should have default board and chess game decides who goes first
- for board evaluation, should king be counted? Should it be 1000?
- how to choose what type of AI in the client code
  player2 = Computer("minimax") vs player2 = Computer(minimax=True)

room for optimization:
- every time a board is calculated, the pieces are all created and thrown away.
  if possible keep all pieces on the board while changing 1-2 that changed from
  that move. This may not matter since each board is a complete copy of another,
  but it might be cleaner code to have piece objects.
- score'ing could be calculated by removing the piece being taken in all cases
  except for en passant which will remove a piece from another nearby square.
  (castling should not change score).
