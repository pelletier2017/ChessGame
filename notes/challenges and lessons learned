is attacking king
- dealing with the current player changing every time a move is made.
  So looking for player in check vs making sure you cant put your king into
  check during a move.

chess game class
- separate logic that used to be in main

player class
- idea is it changes things for when player is a computer vs a person.

organizing tests
- changing board effected pieces and vice versa, so test runner best option.

imports were a pain in the butt
- getting python packaging to work. It felt very inconsistent, sometimes
  working on pycharm and sometimes on command prompt but not both. Should
  default to making it work in command prompt because pycharm is less universal.
- decided to put chess and tests into separate modules and import with
  from chess.board import ChessBoard
