is attacking king
- dealing with the current player changing every time a move is made.
  So looking for player in check vs making sure you cant put your king into
  check during a move.

chess game class
- separate logic that used to be in main

player class
- goal was computer vs computer 1000 games

organizing tests
- changing board effected pieces and vice versa, so test runner best option

imports were a pain in the butt
- getting python packaging to work. It felt very inconsistent, sometimes
  working on pycharm and sometimes on command prompt but not both.\
- decided to put chess and tests into separate modules and import with
  from chess.board import ChessBoard
